/**
 * Handles the disconnection & reconnection logic for all in-game players (not spectators).
 *
 * Logic for handling a disconnected player is slightly different for each game format:
 * - Joust: Players will have X seconds to reconnect. Following that, the opponent can leave without penalty, resulting in a concluded game with no winner.
 * - Melee: Players will have X seconds to reconnect. Following that, opponents will vote to wait an additional X seconds, or eliminate them.
 *          Eliminations must be a unanimous vote, and re-votes keep happening until they reconnect or are voted for elimination.
 *
 * X is configurable, but defaulted to 30 seconds
