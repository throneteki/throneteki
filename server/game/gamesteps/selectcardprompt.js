/**
 * General purpose prompt that asks the user to select 1 or more cards.
 *
 * The properties option object has the following properties:
 * numCards           - an integer specifying the number of cards the player
 *                      must select. Set to 0 if there is no limit on the num
 *                      of cards that can be selected.
 * multiSelect        - boolean that ensures that the selected cards are sent as
 *                      an array, even if the numCards limit is 1.
 * additionalButtons  - array of additional buttons for the prompt.
 * activePromptTitle  - the title that should be used in the prompt for the
 *                      choosing player.
 * waitingPromptTitle - the title that should be used in the prompt for the
 *                      opponent players.
 * cardCondition      - a function that takes a card and should return a boolean
 *                      on whether that card is elligible to be selected.
 * onSelect           - a callback that is called once all cards have been
 *                      selected. On single card prompts this is called as soon
 *                      as an elligible card is clicked. On multi-select prompts
 *                      it is called when the done button is clicked. If the
 *                      callback does not return true, the prompt is not marked
 *                      as complete.
 * onMenuCommand      - a callback that is called when one of the additional
 *                      buttons is clicked.
 * onCancel           - a callback that is called when the player clicks the
 *                      done button without selecting any cards.
