/**
 * Represents a reaction ability provided by card text.
 *
 * Properties:
 * when    - object whose keys are event names to listen to for the reaction and
 *           whose values are functions that return a boolean about whether to
 *           trigger the reaction when that event is fired. For example, to
 *           trigger only at the end of the challenge phase, you would do:
 *           when: {
 *               onPhaseEnded: event => event.phase === 'challenge'
 *           }
 *           Multiple events may be specified for cards that have multiple
 *           possible triggers for the same reaction.
 * title   - function that returns the string to be used as the prompt title. If
 *           none provided, then the title will be "Trigger {card name}?".
 * cost    - object or array of objects representing the cost required to be
 *           paid before the action will activate. See Costs.
 * handler - function that will be executed if the player chooses 'Yes' when
 *           asked to trigger the reaction. If the reaction has more than one
 *           choice, use the choices sub object instead.
 * choices - object whose keys are text to prompt the player and whose values
 *           are handlers when the player chooses it from the prompt.
 * limit   - optional AbilityLimit object that represents the max number of uses
 *           for the reaction as well as when it resets.
 * max     - optional AbilityLimit object that represents the max number of
 *           times the ability by card title can be used. Contrast with `limit`
 *           which limits per individual card.
 * location - string indicating the location the card should be in in order
 *            to activate the reaction. Defaults to 'play area'.
 * player   - optional function that returns which player to prompt for the
 *            ability. By default, the player that controls the card will be
 *            prompted. Used for reactions / interrupts that any player can
 *            trigger such as The Red Wedding.
 * cannotBeCanceled - optional boolean that determines whether an ability can
 *                    be canceled using a cancel interrupt.
