                    <p>
                        I&apos;d like to thank mtgred, and the whole of the jinteki.net development
                        team(except whoever decided to write the code in clojure, not you. - just
                        kidding!) as without their work to use as a guide and as inspiration, this
                        site would not be where it is today. To say jinteki is an inspiration is an
                        understatement.
